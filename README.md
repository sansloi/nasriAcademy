## Nasri Academy Song
Music & Lyrics by Paul Kay

For all of us to be, living in harmony.
Living and growing every day.
Sharing and care, and always daring.
Let curiosity lead us on our way

At Nasri Academy, we hold our heads high.
Reaching for the stars up in the sky.
Without a doubt, we will sin gand shout!
Let the world know what we're al about.

Once we start, with mind, body and heart.
We see the endless possibilities.
Dreaming of tomorrow, the future looks bright. We stand together and sing these
melodies.

At Nasri Academy, we hold our heads high.
Reaching for the stars up in the Sky.
Without a doubt, we will sin gand shout.
Let the world know what we're all about.
